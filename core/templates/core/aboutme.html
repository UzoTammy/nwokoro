            <p class="first-letter">
                I am Uzo Tammy Nwokoro, a graduate of the Federal University of Technology in Nigeria,
                as a Chemical Engineer. My career began with a flourish, as I
                gained valuable project management experience at Shell Nigeria Gas Ltd, just after graduation. This
                one-year stint was not just a job; it was a foundation that set the tone for my diverse career path.
                Through my time in the university, I developed my skills in programming. 
            </p>
            <p class="first-letter">
                Following my time at Shell, I ventured into the distribution sector. Here, I didn't just adapt; I
                transformed the company. Led it's computerized operations and streamlined processes, marking a
                significant leap in efficiency and effectiveness. This achievement landed me the role of Business Operations Manager. 
                For three years, I steered the company with a blend of technical acumen and strategic foresight, continually driving growth 
                and innovation. 
            </p>
            <p class="first-letter">
                The entrepreneurial spirit in me then took the helm, leading to the founding of my own business.
                Specializing in the investment and redistribution of alcoholic beverages, I navigated the complex
                landscape of this industry with skill and determination. This venture wasn't just a business; it was a
                testament to my ability to identify opportunities and capitalize on them.
            </p>
            <p class="first-letter">
                Now, as I pivot towards Information Technology, my true passion, I am excited about the endless
                possibilities this field offers. My journey is a tapestry of diverse experiences, each thread woven with
                dedication, adaptability, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. I stand ready to dive into the IT
                realm, bringing with me a wealth of knowledge and a unique perspective shaped by my varied career path.
            </p>
            <p class="first-letter">
                When I take up a job, I am only inclined to the business case. Where the fusion of technology and business acumen
                promises to create innovative solutions. I have deepened my knowledge in Project Management through a Google
                career opportunity.
